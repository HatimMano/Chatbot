# Fun Hotel Helper Guide

Welcome to the Fun Hotel Helper Guide! 🏨🤖

Let's take a fun stroll through this code and see what surprises await us!

## Lots of Tools!

First up, we've got our handy tools: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and spaCy. These tools help us understand words and numbers better, making our adventure easier!

## Sorting Out Data

We start by getting our data ready. Imagine cleaning up your room before a big adventure – that's what we're doing here!

## Getting Ready

Next, we summon a special language understanding friend called spaCy. It's like having a wizard who can understand what people are saying!

## Let's Chat!

Now comes the exciting part: chatting with our Hotel Helper! It's like having a friendly guide who knows all the best places to stay. We ask questions, and it helps us find the perfect hotel.

## The End

Our adventure ends here, but the Hotel Helper is always ready for more fun. So whenever you need a hand finding a place to stay, just remember our trusty Hotel Helper is here to make your journey a breeze!

Get ready for a fun hotel adventure with the Hotel Helper Guide!
